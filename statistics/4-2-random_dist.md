[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> ***Problem Statement: The numbers generated by numpy.random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from numpy.random.random and plot their PMF. What goes wrong?***

```python
Random_num = np.random.random_sample((1000,))
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(Random_num, label='Random Numbers')

thinkplot.Pmf(pmf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random Numbers', ylabel='Pmf')
```

It is difficult to tell what is happening with the larga quantity of data. 

***Now plot the CDF. Is the distribution uniform?***

```python
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(Random_num, label='np.random')
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random Numbers', ylabel='CDF', loc='upper left')
```

Yes, the CDF is approximately a staight line which means the distribution is uniform.
